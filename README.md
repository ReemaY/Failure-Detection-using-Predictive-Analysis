# Failure-Detection-using-Predictive-Analysis

Background:
Company (3D Technologies) has a fleet of devices transmitting daily aggregated telemetry attributes. 
Predictive maintenance techniques are designed to help determine the condition of in-service equipment in order to predict when maintenance should be performed. This approach promises cost savings over routine or time-based preventive maintenance, because tasks are performed only when warranted. 

Goal:
You are tasked with building a predictive model using machine learning to predict the probability of a device failure. When building this model, be sure to minimize false positives and false negatives. The column you are trying to predict is called failure with binary value 0 for non-failure and 1 for failure.
